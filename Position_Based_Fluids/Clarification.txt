UpdatePosition

Step 1:
	Apply External Forces -- External Forces come from gravity & the walls surrounding fluids
	Note: We assume that acceleration of gravity is 10m/s^2 and
		once the particle hit a wall the component of its velocity which perpendicular to the wall is reversed in direction.
		We can try to apply damping here, but temporarily it's not necessary.

	Get Predict Position

Step 2:
	Find Neighboring particles -- Use KD_Tree (Time complexity--??)

Step 3:
	NOTE: Before perform the following operations, you must figure out the theories behind them.
	SMOOTHING_KERNEL: Poly6 Kernel for density estimation & Spiky Kernel for gradient calculation

	Within the MaxInterations, perform following operations:
	Operation 1:
		calculate lambda_i -- Use queue 'neighboring' obtained from 'FindNeiboring()'
	Operation 2:
		calculate delta_p_i -- Use lambda_i and restRho, how to calculate restRho???
		Perform collision detection and response -- how to response to collision??
	Operation 3:
		Update positions of each particles(Newton Steps??) -- according to the delta_p_i we just calculate

Step 4:
	Update velocity -- according to the position of the particle in the adjacent frames
	Apply vorticity confinement & XSPH viscosity -- why we should apply this??
	Update position
